Several libraries make switching windows in Emacs linear by giving
each window a number. This package generalizes that idea to deleting,
splitting (vertically and horizontally), zooming (i.e.
`delete-other-windows'), growing, shrinking, and swapping windows, and
displaying buffers and files in them.
